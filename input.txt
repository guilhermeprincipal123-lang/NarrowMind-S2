Martin reached the train station earlier than usual that morning. The platform was mostly empty, occupied only by a few office workers waiting quietly with their bags and headphones. He sat on a bench near the far end, planning his day while watching the display board cycle through arrival times.
As he stretched his legs, he noticed a small spiral notebook tucked between the wooden planks of the bench. Its cover was slightly worn, with a faint sticker mark where something had been peeled off. He looked around, but no one seemed to be searching for anything.
He opened the notebook carefully. The first few pages contained neat handwriting, mostly to-do lists, reminders, and short reflections. The entries suggested it belonged to a student — mentions of exams, upcoming projects, and study schedules filled the pages. Halfway through, there were sketches of buildings and street corners around the city, drawn quickly yet confidently.
Martin flipped to the back and found a folded train ticket dated the previous afternoon. It was punched and validated, meaning the owner had likely been at the station only a day earlier. There was also a name scribbled faintly on the inside cover, but the ink had smudged too much to make out.
The morning train approached with a deep rumble, pulling the air along the platform. Martin closed the notebook and held it firmly, unsure whether to hand it to the lost-and-found counter or try to track down the owner himself. As the doors opened, he hesitated. Keeping the notebook felt wrong, but returning it blindly might make it harder for the owner to find.
He stepped onto the train still holding it, deciding he would wait until school hours began. If the notebook belonged to a student nearby, someone would eventually post about it or ask around. Until then, the notebook remained in his bag — a small piece of someone else’s life that had briefly crossed into his.
